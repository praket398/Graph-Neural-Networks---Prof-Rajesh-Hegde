# GNN-Based Bitcoin Fraud Detection  
### Elliptic Dataset — End-to-End Pipeline

This project uses **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to detect illicit Bitcoin transactions using the **Elliptic dataset**. It implements a full pipeline including data preprocessing, graph construction, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Run

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open:

```
GNN_Elliptic_Fraud_Detection_Final.ipynb
```

Run all cells sequentially.

---

### Option 2: VS Code

- Open the notebook in VS Code  
- Run cells using the Jupyter extension  

---

## Process

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Merge features with labels  
- Label mapping:  
  - 1 → illicit  
  - 2 → licit  
  - unknown → -1 (ignored in training)  
- Normalize 165 transaction features  
- Create masks for labeled nodes  

---

### 2. Graph Construction
- Nodes=transactions  
- Edges=transaction flow  
- Built using PyTorch Geometric Data object  

Key components:
- x → node features  
- edge_index → graph connectivity  
- y → labels  
- train/test masks  

---

### 3. Model
- Graph Neural Network (GNN)  
- Learns node representations using neighborhood aggregation  
- Captures:
  - Local features (transaction properties)  
  - Global structure (network connectivity)  

---

### 4. Experiments
- Full feature model (165 features)
- Implemented GCN
- Implemented GraphSage
- Implemented GAT 

---

## Results

The model demonstrates:

- Effective detection of illicit transactions  
- Improved performance when using graph structure vs only local features  
- Ability to capture hidden relationships in transaction networks  

### Observations

- GNN outperforms traditional ML methods  
- Graph structure significantly improves classification  
- Class imbalance affects performance  
- Connectivity patterns are crucial for fraud detection  

---

## Visualizations Included

- Class distribution (pie chart)  
- Feature correlation heatmap  
- Graph degree distribution  

---

## Key Insights

- Fraud detection is inherently a graph problem  
- Transactions are interdependent  
- Structural information boosts predictive performance  

---

## Notes

- Dataset is highly imbalanced  
- Unknown labels are excluded during training  
- Full graph training may be memory intensive  

---

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate temporal dynamics  
- Address class imbalance (weighted loss / resampling)  
- Hyperparameter tuning
